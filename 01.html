<h1>ABOUT BAKING</h1>
<div class="ps">
<img src="journey/journey.jpeg" alt ="journey img" height="250" width="200">
<pre>Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven,
    but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. The most common baked item is bread,
     but many other types of foods can be baked.[1] Heat is gradually transferred "from the surface of cakes, 
     cookies, and pieces of bread to their center. As heat travels through, it transforms batters and
      doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center".[2] Baking can be combined with
       grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other.
        Baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.

<h1>BAKING IN ANCIENT TIMES<h1>
    <pre>The earliest known form of baking occurred when humans took wild grass grains, 
        soaked them in water, and mashed the mixture into a kind of broth-like paste.[3] 
        The paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat, hot rock, resulting in a bread-like substance. 
        Later, when humans mastered fire, the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, 
        as it could now be made any time fire was created. The world's oldest oven was discovered in Croatia in
         2014 dating back 6500 years ago. </pre>
